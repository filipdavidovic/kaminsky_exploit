# Tool to exploit the Kaminsky DNS vulnerability

This tool is an implementation of the vulerability that Dan Kaminsky exposed in 2008. In its current form it works only with IPv4 addresses.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order for this tool to be executable on your machine, you need to have the following installed:

* [Python 2.x or 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy)
* 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Simply clone the code from the GitHub repository.

The example is shown in Git Bash:

1. Open Git Bash

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. You can do that with the following command:
```
$ cd /path/to/directory
```
Note that if the path has whitespaces in it, you need to encapsulate it in quotes(").

3. Clone the respository. You can do that by executing the following command in Git Bash:
```
$ git clone ${REPOSITORY_URL}
```
You can find the respository URL on the GitHub page.

## Usage

Moreover, there are several parameters that are required by the application in order to run. You can execute the Python script from the command line.
